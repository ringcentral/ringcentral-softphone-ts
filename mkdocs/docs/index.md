# RingCentral Cloud Phone SDK

The RingCentral Cloud Phone SDK helps developers connect to authorized live
phone calls in a safe and secure way in order to access and/or manipulate a
call's audio stream. In the world of artificial intelligence, this SDK is a
critical tool in creating agents, extracting audio, injecting audio, generating
transcripts, and more.

## Evolution of the SDK

This SDK began its life as the now-retired
[RingCentral Softphone SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-softphone-js),
which was originally built on SIP over WebSocket (WSS) and used WebRTC for audio
handling.

To improve reliability, scalability, and audio security, we re-architected the
SDK from the ground up. The result was the
[RingCentral Softphone SDK for TypeScript](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-softphone-ts),
which adopted SIP over TLS and SRTP for encrypted audio transmission.

With the shift toward broader capabilities beyond a softphone, we've rebranded
it as the **RingCentral Cloud Phone SDK** â€” a modern, extensible foundation for
building real-time voice applications.
