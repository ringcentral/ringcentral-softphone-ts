# RingCentral Cloud Phone SDK for TypeScript

The RingCentral Cloud Phone SDK helps developers connect to authorized live phone calls in a safe and secure way in order to access and/or manipulate a call's audio stream. In the world of artificial intelligence, this SDK is a critical tool in creating agents, extracting audio, injecting audio, generating transcripts, and more. When combined with the [RingCentral REST API](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/), developers can also control the call in a limited number of ways, including transferring, and terminating calls.
